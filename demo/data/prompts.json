And yet, it was only now, as I gazed out at the endless expanse of water, that I realized just how little I knew about him. His eyes, a piercing yellow, seemed to hold a deep wisdom, a knowledge that went beyond the simple understanding of a wild animal. And yet, when I looked into them, I saw only a glimmer of recognition, a fleeting acknowledgment of our bond. It was as if he knew that I was thinking of him, and that he was thinking of me, but that we were both trapped in a world of ou"

I saw the animals not just as creatures, but as individuals, each with their own stories, their own struggles, their own triumphs.

But as time went on, I began to realize that Ravi was more than just a curious companion - he was a scavenger, a thief, who would steal my food at every opportunity. And yet, despite his thievery, I grew to love him, for he was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, there was still a certain order to the world.

This margin of safety is the product of two elements - and two elements alone: (1) the quality of the investment, and (2) the price paid. The margin of safety is the product of these two factors, and it is the margin of safety which protects the investor from potential loss. An investment, whatever its quality, cannot produce a satisfactory result unless it is purchased at the right price; and a poor investment may operate successfully against a major market decline if bought at the right price.\n\nThe intelligent investor should approach investment with a mind similar to that of the contractor who builds a house.

He understands that uncertainty is an inherent characteristic of investing, and that even the most seemingly safe assets will, from time to time, experience price fluctuations that are as unpredictable as they are unpalatable. Furthermore, he recognizes that safety and value are relative terms - what is satisfactory to one investor may be utterly unbearable to another.\n\nFor instance, a risk-averse investor may regard a stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of fifteen, yielding 5% in dividends, as sendo far too pricey to constitute a sound investment.

          "text": "\"Happy\" by Pharrell Williams does not have lyrics. It is an instrumental song, which means it consists of music only and does not have any sung words or lyrics.\n\nHowever, the song's iconic hook is sung in a spoken word style by Pharrell Williams, which is often mistaken for lyrics. The spoken word part goes like this:\n\n\"Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like a room without a roof\nBecause I'm happy, clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth\nClap along if you know what happiness is to you\nBecause I'm happy, clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do\"\n\nThis part is an integral part of the song, but it's not typically considered traditional lyrics."

Jay-Z (Just a small 4-second spoken part)) has the following lyrics:\n\nVerse 1 (Beyonc\u00e9):\nIf you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it\nIf you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it\nDon't be mad once you see that he want it\nHe didn't even have to say anything\nCheck it, check it\n\nVerse 2 (Beyonc\u00e9):\nThere's many lames out there and if he want it\nTalkin' slick, not thinkin' good 'bout ya\nDon't be mad once you see that he want it\nHe didn't even have to say anything\nCan't let him only be there for the D\nTryna get some not takin' care of me\nKnow what you're worth\n\nChorus (Beyonc\u00e9):\nIf you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it\nIf you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it\nDon't be mad once you see that he want it\nHe didn't even have to say anything\nIf you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it\nIf you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it\n\nVerse 3 (Beyonc\u00e9):\nYou said, \"Put a ring on it\" (Jay-Z)\n 'Cause if you like it"
