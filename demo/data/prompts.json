I've been arguing that the people who stand out at the very top of their fields - the ones who are truly exceptional - are not the ones who are the most talented, but the ones who have put in the most work. The Beatles, for example, were not the most talented musicians in Liverpool. They were the most dedicated, the most persistent, and the most willing to put in the time to hone their craft. And it was that dedication, that persistence, and that willingness to put in the time that ultimately allowed them to become the greatest rock band of all time.\n\nBut where does this dedication come from? Why do some people put in the time, while others do not? The answer, I think, lies in the concept of the '10,000-hour rule.'

The difference is not the quantity of time he puts in, but the quality of the opportunities he has been given - his early exposure to music, the quality of his teachers, the fact that he was born into a family that valued music.

Frankl:\n\n\"We stumbled on in the darkness, over an endless stream of prisoners, all of whom were trudging to the same place. There were men and women, old and young, all equally stark naked, all equally without any dignity. Each prisoner locked eyes with us, and, from behind the barbed wire, we could see the contours of their faces, their eyes, their mouths. We could see the despair in their eyes, the desperation, the hopelessness. And yet, in their eyes, we could also see a glimmer of something else - a spark of defiance, a spark of resistance, a spark of humanity.\n\nAs we walked through the camp, I saw a young boy, no more than twelve years old, who was walking alongside his mother. He was holding her hand, and she was holding his. They were both naked, both equally emaciated, both equally exhausted. But as they walked, the boy looked up at his mother and smiled. And in that moment, I saw something that I will never forget. "

As we walked, the SS men kept shouting at us to move faster, to hurry up, to get back to the camp. We stumbled and staggered, our feet aching and our legs trembling beneath us. We were a group of broken men, our spirits crushed by the weight of our own despair.\n\nAs we approached the camp, I saw the familiar sight of the barbed wire fence, the watchtowers, and the barracks. But something was different. The camp was quiet, eerily quiet. There was no sound of shouting, no sound of laughter, no sound of life.

We had to make our way along this bridge for about a hundred yards, and then we came to a place where the bridge was destroyed. We had to make a jump for it. I was the first to go. I jumped, and landed on the rubble. The others followed, and we all managed to get across. We then came to a place where the bridge was still intact, but it was guarded by a German soldier. He was a young fellow, and he seemed to be in a good mood. He was smoking a cigarette and whistling a tune. We stood there for a while, and then he said to us, 'What are you doing here?'

They would go through the motions of eating, sleeping, and working, but they had lost their will to live. They were no longer capable of experiencing pleasure or pain. They were like automata, devoid of any emotional response. They had given up hope, and in doing so, they had also given up their humanity.\n\nI often wondered how people could sink so low. How could they lose their sense of purpose and meaning in life? I realized that it was not the physical conditions of the camp that had caused this, but the lack of meaning. The prisoners who had lost their sense of purpose were not just reacting to their circumstances, they were also creating their own reality.

Frankl:\n\n\"I can hardly imagine a greater hazard of the human mind than the error of making a virtue of necessity. This error is apt to be committed in situations of extreme hardship, where a person has to make a choice between physical survival and spiritual survival. When, in such situations, the individual clings to a moral conviction, he is easily led to believe that he has found a virtue in the fact that he has managed to maintain his faith in a higher power or in a particular ideology. But, in reality, he has only managed to preserve his life. \n\nThe true test of a person's character lies not in the way he behaves under the pressure of external circumstance, but in the way he behaves when he is free from such pressure. When he is faced with a choice, he has to decide whether to make a virtue of his freedom or to use it for the purpose of achieving something positive.

One day, I was standing in line for the roll call, and a man beside me was trembling with fear. I turned to him and asked, 'What's the matter with you?' 'I was absent from the barracks last night,' he whispered. 'I was caught by a patrol.' 'How much time have you got?' I asked. 'Three days,' he replied. 'Three days?' I repeated. 'No,' he said, 'I was lucky. I got off with three years.' \n\nHe was visibly moved to tears. I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief myself, and I had to remind myself that only a few weeks ago I had been in a similar situation.

In a concentration camp, we stumbled upon a hackneyed idea of the ancient child that life is something that will be given to us, that we are entitled to exist, that reality exists just to satiate our hunger for all possible good, that God wishes to see us happy, but, above all, as this ancient idea has it, that we are immortal as long as we exist - and that somehow we have to squeeze the last ounce of pleasure out of life.\n\nBut the third of us, and the least numerous one, I should think, did live in a world of logical consistency; in other words, in a world where the concept of the concentration camp, which to the others was an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms, was a logical consequence of the ideology that had been preached for years in the name o"

It was a struggle that pitted the futility of existence against the human will to live, and the absurdity of the universe against the human need for significance. I saw men, women, and children who had been reduced to nothing more than empty husks of their former selves, their eyes empty, their bodies weak, their spirits broken. And yet, even in the midst of such unimaginable suffering, I saw a glimmer of hope. It was a hope that was not based on the promise of a better tomorrow, but on t"

We would give ourselves up to the imagination, and try to create in our minds pictures of the future. We would think about the things we would do after the war, about the places we would visit, the work we would take up, the friends we would meet, the love we would find. But we were not allowed to give ourselves up too deeply to these fantasies, for that would have been a betrayal of our fellow prisoners and of ourselves. We would have to be able to return to reality at a moment's notice, to the reality of the present moment, if necessary. \n\nWe would also try to find ways to compensate for the loss of our freedom by creating a new world of our own.

But there exists no way to freedom. There is no way but this: your inner attitude and never an artificially learned optimism, but that of the active person, who realizes that it is performed in inner attitudes. You may tell a man that he is free, but only if he has been inside a concentration camp and comes out, then he can understand freedom, having gone through the horror of the concentration camps. Freedom depends on him, not on his external situation.\n\nNo man should judge unless he asks himself the questions and says: \u2018How can I possibly rate anyone the right to tell me whom he thinks it is my right to love\u2014and who"

Rivest, and Clifford Stein is not feasible here as it would require a significant amount of text. However, I can provide you with an excerpt or a brief passage. \n\nHere's a passage from the preface to the 3rd edition:\n\n**Computer Science and Algorithm Design**\n\nThe study of algorithms is a fundamental part of computer science, and yet it is not necessarily about computers. Rather, it is about the process of taking an impasse - a problem that cannot be solved good enough or done quickly enough - and working with other people to turn it into a solution that satisfies the six desired properties. We typically teach this process only after our students have learned enough about a problem domain not to know how to design a solution, but not so much that they think they can do it by themselves.\n\nTo design an algorithm, you need to discover some technique or"

This margin of safety is the product of two elements - and two elements alone: (1) the quality of the investment, and (2) the price paid. The margin of safety is the product of these two factors, and it is the margin of safety which protects the investor from potential loss. An investment, whatever its quality, cannot produce a satisfactory result unless it is purchased at the right price; and a poor investment may operate successfully against a major market decline if bought at the right price.\n\nThe intelligent investor should approach investment with a mind similar to that of the contractor who builds a house. The contractor does not build two houses on a lot - he builds one house and a margin of safety ar"

He must be prepared to admit when he does not know, and he must be willing to change his opinion when new information becomes available.\"\n\nThis passage is from Chapter 8: \"The Investor and the Market\" of the first edition of \"The Intelligent Investor\" "

However, you can start with a general rule of thumb: if the business of the country is good, you might invest 50% to 75% of your equity in common stocks; if the business is bad, you might invest 25% to 50%.

He understands that uncertainty is an inherent characteristic of investing, and that even the most seemingly safe assets will, from time to time, experience price fluctuations that are as unpredictable as they are unpalatable. Furthermore, he recognizes that safety and value are relative terms - what is satisfactory to one investor may be utterly unbearable to another.\n\nFor instance, a risk-averse investor may regard a stock with a price-to-earnings ratio of fifteen, yielding 5% in dividends, as sendo far too pricey to constitute a sound investment.

This is the most important step, and it's also the hardest. We often don't realize when we're in the grip of a habit, and we don't recognize the cues that trigger our behavior. The reason is that habits are automatic, and our brains don't have the capacity to think about them. When we're in the midst of a habit, we're not thinking, 'I'm going to go to the gym.' We're thinking, 'I'm going to go to the gym.' The difference is subtle, but it's crucial. When we're thinking, 'I'm going to go to the gym,' we're in control. We're making a decision. But when we're thinking, 'I'm going to go to the gym,' we're not making a decision. We're just following a routine.\n\nThis is why it's so hard to change our habits.

She discovered that habits are not just individual actions, but a collection of cues, routines, and rewards that form a loop.

Life is a great and terrible beauty, a mystery that we can't fully grasp. It's an ontological fact, an existence that precedes our understanding of it. But we can't simply accept this as a brute fact. We have to explore it, to examine it, to take our stand in relation to it. And that's what makes life so difficult, because we have to confront the fact that we're just one of many - that our own existence is utterly dependent on a thousand unseen factors, a thousand unseen causes. \n\nBut that's also what makes life so beautiful. We're not the center of the universe, we're not the only ones who think, who feel, who imagine. And that's a tremendous relief, because it takes the burden of the entire universe off our shoulders.

But one day, I was visiting a psychiatrist who was a bit of a mentor to me, and he said, 'Peterson, you're a sad sack.' And I said, 'What's wrong with being a sad sack?' And he said, 'Nothing, but if you're going to be a sad sack, do it on purpose.' And I said, 'What do you mean?' And he said, 'Well, if you're going to be a sad sack, at least do it with your shoulders back.' And I took his advice to heart.\n\nI think this is a very important lesson. When we slouch or slump, we're not just showing physical weakness; we're also showing psychological and moral weakness. We're saying to the world that we're not worthy of respect, that we're not worthy of attention,"

He lectured on the importance of self-esteem, the dangers of societal expectations, and the need for students to \"find their own path.\" However, in his enthusiasm to help, he had completely forgotten that the most important thing he could do for his students was to leave them alone.\n\nIn the same way, a young skateboarder needs to be left alone to master the art of skateboarding. He needs to learn to fall, to get back up, and to persevere. He needs to learn to balance himself, not just physically but also emotionally and mentally. The skateboarder needs to learn to navigate the world, not just the halfpipe.\n\nWhen we try to \"help\" our child"

Now, in that context, the question is not whether it is a burden or an obligation, but whether it can be carried. The task, like all tasks, is at the same time an opportunity. It is an opportunity to exercise what is sometimes called your 'character.' Your character is not a fixed entity; it is something that can be developed, like a muscle. The more you exercise it, the stronger it will become. And as it becomes stronger, you will be able to carry more, to bear more weight, to tolerate more pain. This is a fundamental fact of the human condition.\n\n\"But there is more. When you are faced with a task that feels like a burden, you have a choice to make.

They are prisoners of their own irrationalities, indulging their vulnerabilities with self-destructive behavior. We are inclined to despise such men because they embody the qualities we fear in ourselves, because they announce their own weakness to the world through their puerility and instability. They are exhibiting all the obvious, dreaded failings of character that would invalidate any traditional notion of nobility or honor.

The truth of this observation is beautifully illustrated by considering the differing attitudes of the pessimistic critic and the systematic or optimist. The pessimistic critic assumes that some aspect of the universe is in good order but that everything is viz. an outer dependence on that well-ordered core. Therefore, according to the critic, the outer shell must reasonably only be as strong or less strong, therefore flawed...[[resulting]... function imbalanced]...The optimist, on the other hand, acknowledges the disordered state of the world, but believes that the crux "

For example, if you want to become a better runner, you don't need to suddenly start running 10 miles a day. Instead, you can start by adding 1-2 minutes to your daily run each week. This may not seem like a lot, but over the course of a year, it can add up to a significant increase in your endurance.\n\nThis approach is based on the concept of 'compounding,' which is the idea that small, consistent changes can have a profound impact when they are repeated over time.

But what if we could make small changes instead? What if we could make tiny improvements, one at a time, and build from there?\n\nThis is the power of the 1% rule. It's a simple idea: small, incremental changes can add up to big results over time. If you improve by 1% each day, you'll be 37 times better in a year. That's not a magic number, but it's a reminder that small changes can have a profound impact.\n\nThe 1% rule is not just a metaphor; it's a mathematical fact.

This is the core idea behind the 'aggregation of marginal gains,' a concept popularized by the British cycling team that dominated the Tour de France in the 2000s. The team's coach, Dave Brailsford, realized that small changes in the team's habits and environment could add up to make a big difference in performance. He started by changing the smallest things, like the type of pillows the riders used, the type of soap they washed with, and the type of food they ate. He even changed the color of the team's uniforms to make them more visible in the peloton. By making these small changes, the team was able to shave off precious seconds in each stage, which added up to a significant advantage over the course of the entire competition.\n\n"

These laws were first identified by the psychologist James O. Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente in the 1970s, and they have been widely used to help people understand how to change their behavior.\n\nThe first law is that people are not ready to change until they are aware of their current state. This is often referred to as the 'pre-contemplation stage'. Most people are not aware of their habits and how they are impacting their lives.

In 1946, a psychologist named Karl Duncker conducted an experiment in which he gave people a series of problems to solve. But instead of giving them large, complex problems to tackle, he broke them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. \n\nTo do this, he created a series of small \"badges\" or \"tags\" that participants could earn as they completed each task. The badges were small, almost trivial rewards, but they served as a way to acknowledge progress and motivate people to keep going. \n\nDuncker's findings were striking: when participants received the badges, they were far more likely to complete the tasks than when they did not receive them. But here's the most interesting part: it wasn't the badges themselves that drove people's behavior - it was the sense of identity that came with earning them.

Instead, they focused on making a series of small improvements, which they called the 'aggregation of marginal gains.' The idea was to identify tiny improvements - a 1% gain in nutrition, a 1% gain in equipment, a 1% gain in training - and to add them up. Over time, these small gains would compound and result in massive improvements. The phrase 'aggregation of marginal gains' was coined by the journalist David Epstein in his book 'The Sports Gene.' However, it's a concept that's much older than that. The idea has been around for centuries, and it's been used by anyone from the Wright brothers to the Navy SEALs.

The system itself is like an iceberg, and the habits are like the small pieces of ice that make up the underside of the iceberg. We don't see the iceberg, but we feel the effects of it. And so, we try to change the iceberg itself, instead of the tiny pieces of ice that make it up.\n\nWhen you are trying to make"

This process is called the 'habit loop.' The habit loop consists of three components: a cue, a craving, and a reward.\n\n*   **Cue:** This is the trigger that sets off the habit. In other words, it's the specific situation or environment that tells your brain, 'Hey, it's time to go do this behavior.' The cue can be as simple as seeing a certain logo, smelling certain foods, or feeling a certain emotion. The key is that it's a specific, predictable trigger.\n*   **Craving:** This is the motivation behind the behavior. It's the reason why you want to engage in the habit in the first place. For example, the craving might be to feel energized, to relax, or to feel connected to others. The craving is what drives you to take action.\n*   **Reward:** This is the payoff that comes from engaging in the behavior. It's the"

In fact, research has shown that cues can even exert more influence over us than our consciously derived goals and values. This is because cues bypass our rational brain and speak directly to our animal brain, which is responsible for decision-making.\n\nThink of it this way: when you're trying to exercise regularly, you might set a goal to lose weight or get in shape. You might even make a conscious decision to go to the gym every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7:00 AM. But the truth is, your brain doesn't care about your conscious goals or decisions. What matters most is what your environment is signaling to be the default behavior.\n\nFor example, let's say you live near a park or a hiking trail. Every time you walk past that park or trail, it's like a green light for your brain to say, \"Ah, time for a walk.\" This is because the park or trail is now"

This is what I refer to as the 'identity-based approach' to habit change.  For years, our self-image has been largely defined by our habits, and when we make a change, we're not just changing our surface-level behavior - we're changing who we are.\n\nImagine that you're a resident of a small town and people know you as the 'runner' or the 'reader.'  You've cultivated this identity over time through consistent behavior, and it becomes a fundamental part of your self-image.  If you want to make a change, such as starting to play the guitar, you can't simply 'just start playing the guitar.'  You will need to redefine who you are.  You will need to start seeing yourself as the 'musician.'\n\nThis process of self-redefinition by building new habits requires that you re-evaluate y"

I ordered a pizza, and as I was waiting for it to arrive, I started talking to the owner, a man named Leo.  Leo was an Italian immigrant who had come to the United States with a dream of opening a restaurant.  He had been in the business for many years and had built up a loyal following in Palo Alto.  As we talked, I asked Leo how he had managed to succeed in such a competitive market.\n\nLeo's answer surprised me.  He said that the reason he had been able to build a loyal following was that he had focused on making the best pizza in the world.  Not just the best pizza in Palo Alto, not just the best pizza in the Bay Area, but the best pizza in the world.  He had a chef who was a master of Neapolitan-style pizza, and he had spent years perfecting the recipe.

My parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, had instilled in me a sense of purpose and a strong sense of self-worth. They had always encouraged me to be my best self, to strive for excellence in everything I did. And I had taken that to heart. I was a high achiever, always pushing myself to excel in school, to be the best student, the best athlete, the best daughter. I was a perfectionist, always striving for perfection, always trying to be better.\n\nBut as I grew older, I began to realize that my parents' expectations, while well-intentioned, were also suffocating. They had high standards for me, and I felt like I was constantly living up to them. I felt like I was never good enough, no matter how hard I tried. I felt like I was always being measured against some unattainable ideal, some mythical standard of perfection "

I think it's a common experience, this gradual realization that the people and places we've known all our lives have left their mark on us, often in ways we can't even see.\n\nFor me, it started with my childhood in Chicago's South Side. Growing up, I saw the struggles of my family and my community up close. My parents, Fraser and Marian, worked hard to provide for us, but we lived in a neighborhood where poverty and crime were rampant.

We want to delete all log entries with IDs less than or equal to a user-supplied value. Here's a vulnerable function that demonstrates this attack vector:\n\n```sql\n-- Vulnerable function\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.delete_log(int)\n"

They are the result of a culture that values the idea of building a product over the actual needs of the customers. This is a result of the way we teach entrepreneurship in business school, where the focus is on the business plan, the pitch, and the financial projections. We teach students to write a business plan, to create a PowerPoint presentation, and to raise money from investors. We teach them to focus on the product, to build a prototype, and to test it with a small group of users. But we don't teach them how to learn from those users, how to iterate, and how to pivot.\n\nThe result is a startup that is built on a set of assumptions about what customers want, rather than on a deep understanding of their needs. This is a recipe for disaster. The product is built, launched, and then it fails. The founders are left wondering what went wrong, and they often blame the market, the competition, or"

The key to success is not to create a perfect product, but to create a product that is good enough to get feedback from customers.\n\nThe idea of 'good enough' is a powerful one. It means that you don't have to have the perfect solution to the problem you're trying to solve. You just have to have a solution that is good enough to get people to try it out.

This approach is based on the idea that innovation is a linear process, where you start with a good idea and then execute it flawlessly. But this approach is based on a flawed assumption: that we can predict the future. We can't. The future is inherently uncertain, and the best way to deal with uncertainty is to build a system that can adapt to it.\n\nThe Lean Startup is based on the idea that innovation is a process of experimentation and learning.

The problem is that it's impossible to identify a single product that will appeal to everyone. Every product is a compromise, and the more features you try to include, the more compromises you have to make. The result is a product that appeals to no one. This is known as the \"kitchen sink\" approach, where you try to include as many features as possible in the hope that something will stick.\n\nThis approach is often driven by the desire to avoid the risk of failure. Companies are afraid that if they build a product that is too narrow in focus, it will fail because it doesn't appeal to a broad enough audience. But the opposite is true: a product that is too broad is far more likely to fail. This is because it will try to appeal to too many different people, and it will end up appealing to no one.\n\nThe lean startup "

We should focus on creating a product that is just good enough to allow us to validate our assumptions about the market and our product.\n\nThis idea is often misunderstood as \"good enough\" meaning \"bad.\" But that's not what it means at all. Good enough means \"good enough to allow us to learn.\" It means creating a product that is good enough to allow us to see if people will pay for it, if people will use it, and if it will solve their problems in a way tha"

But this is a recipe for disaster. A startup is an organization that is designed to be lean, agile, and responsive to change. It is not designed to follow a fixed plan. In fact, the plan is nothing more than a guess, and a guess is not a plan.\n\n\"The idea that a startup should have a five-year plan is a myth that has been perpetuated by business schools, consulting firms, and even some venture capitalists. But it is a myth that is based on the idea that a startup is like a large corporation, with a fixed set of assets and a stable market. But startups are not like that. They are small, they are agile, and they are adaptable.\n\n\"The problem with a five-year plan is that it is based on a set of assumptions that are likely to be proven wrong.

It's a feedback loop that drives the entrepreneur's decision-making process, allowing them to validate or invalidate their hypotheses about their customers and their needs.

It's a key part of the Lean Startup methodology. When you launch a startup, you have to be prepared to pivot if something isn't working. The entrepreneur who can't pivot is like a ship without a rudder. He or she is at the mercy of the wind and the waves. \n\nOne example of a pivot is Google's decision to change its search engine from a directory of web pages to an algorithm-based search engine. This decision was made in response to the fact that the directory model was not scalable and was producing results that were often irrelevant to the user. Google's founders realized that the best way to create a useful search engine was to rank pages based on the number and quality of links to them, rather than to try to manually maintain a directory of all the web p"

But that's not exactly correct. The MVP is actually a product that allows you to test a key assumption or hypothesis about your business without requiring a massive investment of time, money, or resources. With the right product design for your MVP, you can create a product that allows customers to inform your next phase of development. By keeping your MVP simple and minimal, you can quickly test the theories you have about how your product will be received and make adjustments accordingly.\n\nIn the early days of IMVU, a virtual worlds platform, it took seven iterations of the company's product before achieving scaling success with paying us"

This program of persistence and preparation and denial paralyzes individuals and creates the exact behavior that is opposite of  what is needed - caution, not awareness - and digest constantly not seeking to factor in the inevitable mistakes of failures.\n\nHowever in the early stage companies especially, they fail constantly due to the absence of a clear sense of how to know when something's valuable, when to pivot, and when to persevere.

This means fostering a culture that is open to iteration and experimentation. As I've said before, the average startup will experience at least three major pivots during its lifespan. And while this may seem like a daunting task, it's essential to success. In fact, the startups that fail are those that are unwilling to pivot, that hang onto their original vision too tightly. They refuse to acknowledge that their initial idea, despite the data that suggests it's not working, is somehow correct.\n\n\"One of the key tools for creating a culture that is amenable to pivoting is the Build-Measure-Learn loop.
